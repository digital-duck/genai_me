# GenAI and Me
This is a collective learning space for GenAI and its applications. 

The goal is to learn and share knowledge about GenAI, including its applications, tools, and techniques. 

Empower ourselves with GenAI and be productive and thrive in the new era. 

Get started with GenAI such as RAG, Agent, cool apps.
